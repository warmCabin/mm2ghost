0x0042 seems to indicate facing, in an abstract gameplay sort of way.
40 = right, 0 = left.

* You can release an atomic fire during knockback, even though you can't properly initiate a charge in this state.
  If you do this, you will be in a strange state where Mega Man is stunned and flashing like with normal knockback,
  but in a walking animation instead of a knocked back animation. It's hard to notice under the flashing.
