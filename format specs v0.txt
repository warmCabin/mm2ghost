Following this header is length frames of data.

Each frame starts with 5 bytes:
xPos yPos xScrl animIndex flags

xPos:
Mega Man's X pixel position in the world.

yPos:
Mega Man's Y pixel position in the world
	
xScrl:
How many pixels the screen is scrolled.
This, combined with xPos and the current X scroll in the emulator, is used to calculate the draw position
on the emulator screen.

animIndex:
Mega Man's animation index (walking, jumping, etc). 0xFF is a sentinel value unused by the game, which
signifies no animation (Mega Man is offscreen, etc.) in this file.
For a full list of animIndex values and their meanings, see animIndex.txt
	
flags:
These flags indicate certain states, as described below. Extra bytes may follow, depending on which are set.
