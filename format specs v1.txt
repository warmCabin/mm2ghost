0x00-0x03: 4-byte signature: 6D 6D 32 67 ("mm2g")
0x04-0x05: version number: 2-byte, unsigned, big-endian (should be 00 01)
0x06-0x09: length: 4-byte, unsigned, big-endian

Following this header is length frames of data.

Each frame starts with 5 bytes:
xPos yPos xScrl flags

xPos:
Mega Man's X pixel position in the world.
yPos:
Mega Man's Y pixel position in the world
	
xScrl:
How many pixels the screen is scrolled.
This, combined with xPos and the current X scroll in the emulator, is used to calculate the draw position
on the emulator screen.
	
flags:
7654 3210
---- -AWF
|||| ||||
|||| |||+- Flipped: whether Mega Man's sprite is flipped (facing right). Updates every frame.
|||| ||+-- Weapon: set when the currently equipped weapon changes. When this bit is 1,
|||| ||    the index of the new weapon will follow, on the range [0,12].
|||| |+--- Animation: set when Mega Man's animation index changes. When this bit is 1,
|||| |     the index of the new animation will follow. 0xFF is a sentinel value unused by
|||| |     the game, which signifies no animation (Mega Man is offscreen, etc.) in this file.
++++-+---- Unused. Set to 0.
	
If multiple "extra byte" bits are active, their corresponding extra bytes will appear in order from least to most
significant bit. i.e., Weapon, then Animation.
